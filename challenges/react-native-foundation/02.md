# React Native Foundation

## What you will learn

- Use the `expo-cli`
- Install a library with `yarn`
- Use VSCode to code from your computer

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- You should have VSCode on your laptop
- You should have the [`expo-cli` installed](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/)
- Have a look at the [scrollview documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview)

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 2

- [ ] On your terminal create a new application with

```console
expo init spacecraft -t expo-template-blank-typescript
```

- [ ] On your terminal

```console
yarn add react-native-paper
```

- [ ] Paste your LoginScreen from the exercice 1 Snack into `App.tsx`

Congratulations 👏! You should have something like this:

![Login Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/challenges/react-native-foundation/login.png)

Now we are going to create another Screen. Fell free to kill/relaunch the expo server if you encounter errors.

- [ ] Rename `App.tsx` to `LoginScreen.tsx` and create 2 folders `src` and `screens` like this


```console
.
├── App.tsx
├── package.json
├── src
│    └── screens
│          └── LoginScreen.tsx
├── tsconfig.json
└── yarn.lock
```

- [ ] Create a new file `App.tsx`
```
// App.tsx

import React from 'react';
import LoginScreen from './src/screen/LoginScreen';

const App = () => {
  return <LoginScreen />;
};

export default App;

```

### 👽 Bonus

- [ ] Create a custom `FormInput` component
