# React Native Foundations

## Learning objectives

- Use a real device to feel the "React Native way of working"‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
- Discover [React Native Core Components and APIs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis)
- Using a [UI library `react-native-paper`](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/)

## ü•ë Before we start the exercise

- You should have VSCode on your laptop
- You should have the [`expo-cli` installed](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/)

## ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Exercise 2 - Use VSCode to code from your computer

- [ ] On your terminal `expo init spacecraft -t expo-template-blank-typescript`
- [ ] Paste your LoginScreen from the exercice 1 Snack into `App.tsx`
- [ ] Rename `App.tsx` to `LoginScreen.tsx`
- [ ] Create a new file `App.tsx` and past the content from this TermsScreen
- [ ] There is a bug, it can't display all the content. You need to change the View so it has scroll

Nice! We've got our first view with a scroll.
Next it's going to use a more performant scroll for long lists.

- [ ] Got to `App.tsx` and change the screen from `TermsScreen` to `TimelineScreen`.
- [ ] Go to `src/exercice/01/TimelineScreen.tsx`, you should have a "stringifyied" version of timeline data
- [ ] Implement a `FlatList` for the data that is fetched.
  - [ ] Add some dummy data with `data={timeline}`
  - [ ] Render `TweetItem` with `renderItem={this.renderItem}`

### üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Bonus

You can use the following icons [https://docs.expo.io/guides/icons/](https://docs.expo.io/guides/icons/)

- [ ] Add [FontAwesome icons](https://oblador.github.io/react-native-vector-icons/)
- [ ] Create your custom `TextInput` and `Button` component
