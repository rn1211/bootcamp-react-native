# React Native Foundation

## What you will learn

- Use the `expo-cli`
- Install a library with `yarn`
- Use VSCode to code from your computer

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- You should have VSCode on your laptop
- You should have the [`expo-cli` installed](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/)

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 2

- [ ] On your terminal create a new application with

```console
expo init spacecraft -t expo-template-blank-typescript
```

- [ ] To preview the app run this and scan the QR Code

```console
yarn start
```

Next, take a look at the project files in your text editor.

- The `package.json` file lists all available scripts and dependencies. Installing any new library updates this file.
- In every Expo project we also have an `app.json` file, which contains all the metadata for our app. This includes the app's name, bundle identifiers, and more.
- Lastly, we have our `App.tsx` file, which is an entry point for our application. Try changing text inside the `<Text>` component to see the changes immediately apply to the content in our app.

One thing you can do next is create a `src` folder where all our components and screens will be.

- [ ] On your terminal

```console
yarn add react-native-paper
```

- [ ] Paste your LoginScreen from the exercice 1 Snack into `App.tsx`

Congratulations 👏! You should have something like this:

Now we are going to create another Screen. Fell free to kill/relaunch the expo server if you encounter errors.

- [ ] Rename `App.tsx` to `LoginScreen.tsx` and create 2 folders `src` and `screens` like this

```console
.
├── App.tsx
├── package.json
├── src
│    └── screens
│          └── LoginScreen.tsx
├── tsconfig.json
└── yarn.lock
```

- [ ] Create a new file `App.tsx`

```javascript
// App.tsx

import React from 'react';
import LoginScreen from './src/screen/LoginScreen';

const App = () => {
  return <LoginScreen />;
};

export default App;
```

Congratulations 👏! You created yout first screen component.

Remember, in **React Native everything is a component**.

It is always a good idea to create small components to your project. In our case we are going to add a `<Header>` component.
They will be used to display important information on the screen.

Create a new folder and file like this

```console
├── src
│    └── components
│          └── Header.tsx

```

And copy your previous header, or you can take this one

```javascript
// ./src/components/Header.tsx
import { View } from "react-native";
import { Text } from "react-native-paper";

const Header = (props) => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text
        style={styles.header}
        {...props}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    padding: 24,
  }
  header: {
    fontSize: 15,
    lineHeight: 21,
    textAlign: "center",
    marginBottom: 12,
  },
});

export default Header;
```

As you can see we are using the Text component exported from `react-native-paper` instead of the Text component from `react-native`. This is because we want to ensure that our text will use the same theme.

## 👽 Bonus

- [ ] Create a custom `FormInput` component
- [ ] Create a better ux for the password with an eye icon
