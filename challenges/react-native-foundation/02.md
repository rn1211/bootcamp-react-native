# React Native Foundations

## Learning objectives

- Use a real device to feel the "React Native way of working"™️
- Discover [React Native Core Components and APIs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis)
- Using a [UI library `react-native-paper`](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/)

## 🥑 Before we start the exercise

- You should have VSCode on your laptop
- You should have the [`expo-cli` installed](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/)
- Have a look at the [scrollview documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview)

## 🤸‍♀️ Exercise 2 - Use VSCode to code from your computer

- [ ] On your terminal create a new application with
```console
expo init spacecraft -t expo-template-blank-typescript
```
- [ ] On your terminal
```console
yarn add react-native-paper
```
- [ ] Paste your LoginScreen from the exercice 1 Snack into `App.tsx`

Congratulations 👏! You should have something like this:

Now we are going to create another Screen. Fell free to kill/relaunch the expo server if you encounter errors.

- [ ] Rename `App.tsx` to `LoginScreen.tsx`
- [ ] Create a new file `App.tsx` and paste the content [from this TermsScreen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/challenges/react-native-foundation/spacecraft/TermsScreen.tsx)
- [ ] Fix the `View` bug, it can't display all the content.

### 🏋️‍♀️ Bonus

- [ ] Create your custom `TextInput` and `Button` component
