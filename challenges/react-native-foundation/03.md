# React Native Foundations

## Learning objectives

- Render list of data
- Discover [React Native Core Components and APIs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis)
- Using a [UI library `react-native-paper`](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/)

## 🥑 Before we start the exercise

- You should know [what is a `cURL`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL)
- Have a look at the [flatlist documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist)


## 🤸‍♀️ Exercise 3 - Performant Scroll for long lists

- [ ] Rename `App.tsx` to `TermsScreen.tsx`.
- [ ] Create a new file `App.tsx`
- [ ] Create a new file `App.tsx` and paste the content [from this TermsScreen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/challenges/react-native-foundation/spacecraft/FeedScreen.tsx)

- [ ] Run from your terminal to download dummy data on your computer.
```console
curl https://swapi.dev/api/starships/ > data.ts
```

⚠️ For Windows users [you can copy/paste this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/challenges/react-native-foundation/spacecraft/data.ts).

- [ ] Create an exported variable on `data.ts`
```
export const data = {
  "count": 36,
  ...
}
```

- [ ] You should have a "stringifyied" version of the data
- [ ] Implement a `FlatList` for the data that is fetched.
  - [ ] Add some dummy data with `data={data.results}`
  - [ ] Render `Item` with `name`, `model` and `crew`

### 🏋️‍♀️ Bonus
