# React Native Foundation

## What you will learn

- Add a simple `<ScrollView>`
- Add a performant Scroll for long lists with `<FlatList>`
- What is a `<Fragment>` component

## üëæ Before we start the exercise

- You should know [what is a `cURL`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL), if not [ask me directly](https://twitter.com/flexbox_)
- Have a look at the [`ScrollView` documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview)‚Ä¶
- ‚Ä¶ and the [`FlatList` documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist).

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Exercise 3

We are not going to explore how the navigation works. For now, we need to update the routing manually and change exported screens.

Here is an example of the entry point of our application:

```typescript
// App.tsx

import React from 'react';
import LoginScreen from './src/screen/LoginScreen';
import TermsScreen from './src/screen/TermsScreen';
import WhatEverScreen from './src/screen/WhatEverScreen';

const App = () => {
  return (
    // <LoginScreen />
    // <TermsScreen />
    <WhatEverScreen />
  );
};

export default App;
```

üî≠ One important thing to mention: **React can export only one child**. If you have this error `JSX expressions must have one parent element` use a [React Fragment](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html) or a `<View>` to wrap all your elements.

You can use React Fragments by wrapping your child elements to be returned by your component with a `<React.Fragments>`. Returning to the example above, the LoginScreen component would be written like this:

```typescript
const LoginScreen = () => {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <TextInput />
      <TextInput />
      <Button>Login</Button>
    </React.Fragments>
  );
};
```

React Fragments can also be employed with a short syntax, which looks like an empty tag:

```typescript
const LoginScreen = () => {
  return (
    // using <> is just like using <React.Fragment>
    <>
      <TextInput />
      <TextInput />
      <Button>Login</Button>
    </>
    // using </> is just like using </React.Fragment>
  );
};
```

We are using Fragment to avoid unnecessary `<View>` markup.

Let's now create 2 differents screens!

- [ ] Create a new file `./src/screens/TermsScreen.tsx` paste the content [from this TermsScreen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/hackathon/spacecraft/src/screen/exercice/TermsScreen.tsx)
- [ ] Fix the `View` bug with a `ScrollView` because it can't display all the content.

üõ∞ This is an important feature to display simple content. But there is another way to display lists.

- [ ] Create a new file `./src/screens/FeedScreen.tsx` and paste the content [from this FeedScreen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/hackathon/spacecraft/src/screen/exercice/FeedScreen.tsx)
- [ ] Run from your terminal to download dummy data on your computer.

```console
curl https://swapi.dev/api/starships/ > data.ts
```

---

‚ö†Ô∏è For Windows users [you can copy/paste this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/hackathon/spacecraft/api/data.ts).

- [ ] Create an exported variable on `data.ts`

```javascript
export const data = {
  "count": 36,
  ...
}
```

---

You should have a "stringifyied" version of the data

![json preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/challenges/react-native-foundation/json-version.png)

- [ ] Implement a `FlatList` for the data that is fetched.
  - [ ] Add some dummy data with `data={data.results}`
  - [ ] Render `Item` with `name`, `model`, `crew`, `hyperdrive_rating` and `cost_in_credits`

### üëΩ Bonus

- [ ] Use a [Card to render items](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/card.html)
