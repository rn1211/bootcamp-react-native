# React Native Foundations

## What you will learn

- Render list of data
- Add a performant Scroll for long lists

## üëæ Before we start the exercise

- You should know [what is a `cURL`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL)
- Have a look at the [flatlist documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist)

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Exercise 3

- [ ] Rename `App.tsx` to `TermsScreen.tsx`.
- [ ] Create a new file `App.tsx`
- [ ] Create a new file `App.tsx` and paste the content [from this TermsScreen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/challenges/react-native-foundation/spacecraft/FeedScreen.tsx)

- [ ] Run from your terminal to download dummy data on your computer.

```console
curl https://swapi.dev/api/starships/ > data.ts
```

---

‚ö†Ô∏è For Windows users [you can copy/paste this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/challenges/react-native-foundation/spacecraft/data.ts).

- [ ] Create an exported variable on `data.ts`

```javascript
export const data = {
  "count": 36,
  ...
}
```

---

You should have a "stringifyied" version of the data
