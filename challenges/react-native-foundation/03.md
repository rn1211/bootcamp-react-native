# React Native Foundation

## What you will learn

- Add a simple `ScrollView`
- Add a performant Scroll for long lists
- Render list of data

## üëæ Before we start the exercise

- You should know [what is a `cURL`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL), if not [ask me directly](https://twitter.com/flexbox_)
- Have a look at the [scrollview documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview)‚Ä¶
- ‚Ä¶ and the [flatlist documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist).

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Exercise 3

- [ ] Create a new file `./src/screens/TermsScreen.tsx` paste the content [from this TermsScreen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/challenges/react-native-foundation/hackathon/spacecraft/src/screen/exercice/TermsScreen.tsx)
- [ ] Fix the `View` bug with a `ScrollView` because it can't display all the content.

üõ∞ This is an important feature to display simple content. But there is another way to display lists.

- [ ] Create a new file `./src/screens/FeedScreen.tsx` and paste the content [from this TermsScreen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/challenges/react-native-foundation/hackathon/spacecraft/exercice/FeedScreen.tsx)
- [ ] Run from your terminal to download dummy data on your computer.

```console
curl https://swapi.dev/api/starships/ > data.ts
```

---

‚ö†Ô∏è For Windows users [you can copy/paste this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/hackathon/spacecraft/api/data.ts).

- [ ] Create an exported variable on `data.ts`

```javascript
export const data = {
  "count": 36,
  ...
}
```

---

You should have a "stringifyied" version of the data

- [ ] Implement a `FlatList` for the data that is fetched.
  - [ ] Add some dummy data with `data={data.results}`
  - [ ] Render `Item` with `name`, `model`, `crew`, `hyperdrive_rating` and `cost_in_credits`

### üëΩ Bonus

- [ ] Use a [Card to render items](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/card.html)
