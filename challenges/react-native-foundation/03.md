# React Native Foundation

## üì° What you will learn

- What is a `<Fragment>` component
- Add a simple `<ScrollView>`
- Add a performant Scroll for long lists with `<FlatList>`

## üëæ Before we start the exercise

We **are not going to explore how the navigation works** in this exercice. For now, we need to update the routing manually and change exported screens.

Here is an example of the entry point of our application:

```javascript
// App.tsx

import React from "react";
import { LoginScreen } from "./src/screens/LoginScreen";
import { TermsScreen } from "./src/screens/TermsScreen";
import { WhatEverScreen } from "./src/screens/WhatEverScreen";

const App = () => {
  return (
    // <LoginScreen />
    // <TermsScreen />
    <WhatEverScreen />
  );
};

// always export default App otherwise Expo is not happy
export default App;
```

üî≠ One important thing to mention: **React can export only one child**. If you have this error `JSX expressions must have one parent element` use a [React Fragment](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html) or a `<View>` to wrap all your elements.

You can use React Fragments by wrapping your child elements to be returned by your component with a `<React.Fragment>`. Returning to the example above, the LoginScreen component would be written like this:

```javascript
export const LoginScreen = () => {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <TextInput />
      <TextInput />
      <Button>Login</Button>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
};
```

React Fragments can also be employed with a short syntax, which looks like an empty tag:

```javascript
const LoginScreen = () => {
  return (
    // using <> is just like using <React.Fragment>
    <>
      <TextInput />
      <TextInput />
      <Button>Login</Button>
    </>
    // using </> is just like using </React.Fragment>
  );
};
```

We are using Fragment to avoid unnecessary `<View>` markup.

Let's now create 2 differents screens!

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Exercise 3

### Allow users to Scroll content

- [ ] Have a look at the [`ScrollView` documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview)
- [ ] Create a new file `./src/screens/TermsScreen.tsx` paste the content [from this TermsScreen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/hackathon/spacecraft/src/screens/exercice/TermsScreen.tsx)
- [ ] Fix the `View` bug with a `ScrollView` because it can't display all the content.

### Render a list of data

üõ∞ This is an important feature to display a list of data.

- [ ] Create a new file `./src/screens/StarshipFeedScreen.tsx` and paste the content [from this StarshipFeedScreen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/hackathon/spacecraft/src/screens/exercice/StarshipFeedScreen.tsx)
- [ ] Run from your terminal to download dummy data on your computer.

```console
mkdir api
curl https://swapi.py4e.com/api/starships/ > api/data.json
```

---

‚ö†Ô∏è For Windows users [you can copy/paste this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/hackathon/spacecraft/api/data.json).

---

You should have a "stringifyied" version of the data

![json preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/challenges/react-native-foundation/json-version.png)

- [ ] Implement a `FlatList` for the data that is fetched.
  - [ ] Add some dummy data with `data={data.results}`
  - [ ] Render `Item` with `name`, `model`, `crew`, `hyperdrive_rating` and `cost_in_credits`

### üëΩ Bonus

- [ ] Use a [Card to render items](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/card.html)
- [ ] On each Card [display a local Image](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image).
  - You will need to use `require("../../assets/starships/imagename.jpg")` for the Image `source`
  - Yon can download all the images here.
