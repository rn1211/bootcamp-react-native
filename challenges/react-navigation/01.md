# React Navigation

## 📡 What you will learn

- Routing and navigation for your React Native apps

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- There are others routing solutions available, keep in mind **we are using [`react-navigation` library](https://reactnavigation.org/)**
- We are using the last version of `react-navigation` (Be carreful when you randomly copy/paste Stack Overflow)
- TypeScript definitions are a bit complicated with `react-navigation` just ignore them or add `any`.

Here is a preview of our application UX:

### Installation

**Hint:** You can read the [Getting started](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started).

```console
yarn add @react-navigation/native
```

```console
expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
```

⚠️ Noticed that you just installed **the core packages**, for every type of navigator (`Native Stack`, `Drawer`, `Bottom Tabs`…) you will need to **install other packages**.

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 1

**Hint:** You can read the [stack-navigator documentation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/hello-react-navigation).

### Organise your routes

- [ ] Create a "sitemap" of all your routes. This will help-us to have a single source of truth for all your routes.

> Enums is a TypeScript type to allow a developer defining a set of named constants.

```javascript
// ./src/navigation/Routes.ts

export enum Routes {
  LOGIN_SCREEN = 'Login',
  TERMS_SCREEN = 'Terms',
  STARSHIP_FEED_SCREEN = 'Starships',
  STARSHIP_DETAIL_SCREEN = 'Starship',
}
```

### Create your first Stack

- [ ] Create a Stack Navigator in `./src/navigation/Navigator.tsx` that shows the `LoginScreen` and the `TermsScreen`
- [ ] Use `LOGIN_SCREEN` and `TERMS_SCREEN` from `Routes.ts`as route names to maintain consistency when navigating
- [ ] Wrap your `Stack` with a `NavigationContainer`

**Hint:** You can have multiple `function`s in the same file.

- [ ] Update the **entry point of your application**.

- [ ] We have an issue with the double header, we can fix it with some options within the `Navigator`

```javascript
screenOptions={{ headerShown: false }}
```

### Navigate to another screen

Do you remeber the `<Text>` "by login you accept the Terms and Conditions."? We will use the `navigate()` function to go to another screen.

![react-navigation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/challenges/react-navigation/react-navigation-focus.png)

- [ ] Wrap the terms link with a

```javascript
<TouchableOpacity onPress={navigateToTerms}>
  ...
</TouchableOpacity>
```

Here is a function to navigate between screens:

```javascript
function navigateToTerms() {
  navigation.navigate(Routes.TERMS_SCREEN);
}
```

- [ ] Add a `goBack` behavior on `TermsScreen.tsx`
