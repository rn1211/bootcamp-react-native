# React Navigation

## Learning objectives

- Routing and navigation for your React Native apps

## 🥑 Before we start the exercise

- There are others routing solutions available, keep in mind we are using the `react-navigation` library
- We are using `react-navigation v5.x.x` (Be carreful when you random copy/paste Stack Overflow)

## 🏄 Installation

**Hint:** You can read the [Getting started](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started)

```console
yarn add @react-navigation/native
```

```console
expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
```

## 🤸‍♀️ Exercise 1

**Hint:** You can read the [stack-navigator documentation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/stack-navigator/)

- [ ] Create a "sitemap" of all your routes

```javascript
// ./src/navigation/AppRoute.ts

export enum AppRoute {
  LOGIN_SCREEN = 'Login',
  TERMS_SCREEN = 'Terms',
  TIMELINE_SCREEN = 'Timeline',
  STARSHIP_DETAIL_SCREEN = 'Starship',
  PILOT_PROFILE = 'Pilot',
}
```

- [ ] Create a Stack Navigator in `./src/navigation/Navigator.tsx` that shows the `LoginScreen` and the `TermsScreen`
- [ ] Use `LOGIN_SCREEN` and `TERMS_SCREEN` from `AppRoute.ts`as route names to maintain consistency when navigating
- [ ] Update the **entry point of your application**. Wrap your `Stack` with `NavigationContainer` using the Stack Navigator from `./src/navigation/Navigator.tsx`

**Hint:** If you are lost you can debug the changes on the `NavigationContainer` with:

```javascript
onStateChange={state => console.log('New state is', state)}
```

- [ ] We have an issue with the double header, we can fix it with some options to the `Navigator`

```javascript
headerMode={'none'}
mode={'modal'}
initialRouteName={AppRoute.LOGIN_SCREEN}
```

- [ ] Wrap the terms link with a `TouchableOpacity onPress={handleTerms}`

Here is a function to navigate between screens

```javascript
function handleTerms() {
  navigation.navigate(AppRoute.TERMS_SCREEN);
}
```

- [ ] Add a `goBack` behavior on `TermsScreen.tsx`
