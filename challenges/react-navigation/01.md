# React Navigation

## Learning objectives

- Understand how routing works on mobile application

## ü•ë Before we start the exercise

- There are others routing solutions available, keep in mind we are using the `react-navigation` library
- We are using `react-navigation v5.x.x` (Be carreful when you random copy/paste Stack Overflow)

![react-navigation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/challenges/react-navigation/react-navigation.png)

**Hint:** You can read the [stack-navigator documentation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/stack-navigator/)

## ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Exercise 1

- [ ] Create a "sitemap" of all your routes

```
// ./src/navigation/AppRoute.ts

export enum AppRoute {
  LOGIN_SCREEN = 'Login',
  TERMS_SCREEN = 'Terms',
  TIMELINE_SCREEN = 'Timeline',
  STARSHIP_DETAIL_SCREEN = 'Starship',
  PILOT_PROFILE = 'Pilot',
}
```

- [ ] Create a Stack Navigator in `./src/navigation/Navigator.tsx` that shows the `LoginScreen` and the `TermsScreen`
- [ ] Use `LOGIN_SCREEN` and `TERMS_SCREEN` from `AppRoute.ts`as route names to maintain consistency when navigating

- [ ] Update the entry point of your application. Wrap your `Stack` with `NavigationContainer` using the Stack Navigator from `./src/navigation/Navigator.tsx`

**Hint:** If you are lost you can debug the changes on the `NavigationContainer` with `onStateChange={state => console.log('New state is', state)}`

- [ ] We have an issue with the double header, we can fix it with some options to the `Navigator`

```javascript
headerMode={'none'}
mode={'modal'}
initialRouteName={AppRoute.LOGIN_SCREEN}
```

- [ ] Wrap the terms link with a `TouchableOpacity onPress={handleTerms}`

Here is a function to navigate between screens

```
function handleTerms() {
  navigation.navigate(AppRoute.TERMS_SCREEN);
}
```

- [ ] Add a `goBack` behavior on `TermsScreen.tsx`
