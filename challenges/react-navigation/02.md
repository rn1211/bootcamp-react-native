## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- Check the [navigation-prop documentation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-prop/#navigate)

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 2

Go to `src/screens/StarshipFeedScreen.tsx`:

- [ ] The header title for this view should be `Starships`
- [ ] Implement `handlePress` function to send the user to the `STARSHIP_DETAIL_SCREEN`, passing the `starshipId` as a parameter.

Go and create `src/Screens/StarshipDetailScreen.tsx`:

- [ ] Set the header title for this view should be the name of the Starship
- [ ] Implement a `handlePilotPress` function to send the user to the `PILOT_SCREEN` screen, passing the parameters below:

```javascript
interface ProfileScreenProps {
  starshipId: number;
  pilots: [];
}
```

## 👽 Bonus

- [ ] Create [an `<Avatar />` component](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/avatar-image.html) with a custom picture for pilots. Just download images form the web and import them in your `./assets/` folder.
