## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- Check the [navigation-prop documentation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-prop/#navigate)

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 2

### Navigating to another screens with `params`

Go to `src/screens/StarshipFeedScreen.tsx`:

- [ ] The header title for this view should be `Starships`
- [ ] Implement `handlePress` function to send the user to the `STARSHIP_DETAIL_SCREEN`, passing the `starship` data as parameters

**Hint:** If you are lost you can [debug the changes on the `NavigationContainer` with `onStateChange`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-container/#initialstate)

### Create a details Screen

Go and create `src/Screens/StarshipDetailScreen.tsx`:

![react-navigation details screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/challenges/react-navigation/details-screen.png)

- [ ] Read the params in your screen component with `route.params`

You can use these component to make it pretty:

```javascript
import {
  Colors,
  Headline,
  Subheading,
  Chip,
  DataTable,
  List,
} from "react-native-paper";
```

## 👽 Bonus

- [ ] Create [an `<Avatar />` component](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/avatar-image.html) with a custom picture for pilots. Just download images form the web and import them in your `./assets/` folder.
