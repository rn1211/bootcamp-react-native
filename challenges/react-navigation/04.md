## Learning objectives

- Add an auth flow

## ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Exercise 4 Authentication

- [ ] Add an Authentication flow to your application

You can read the documentation [https://reactnavigation.org/docs/auth-flow](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/auth-flow)
_Hint:_ For now you can emulate the token with a simple `useState`. Later we will see how to use `AsyncStorage` to keep the token on the phone.

### üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Bonus `createBottomTabNavigator`

Create a `BottomTabNavigator` and use it as `PrivateNavigator` for your app. This will be an extra layer on your app. the entry point for your Private Section.

- [ ] Create a `PrivateNavigator` file to start with.
- [ ] Change `options` to the tab and use `tabBarLabel` and `tabBarIcon`
- [ ] The two tabs should be the `MAIN_TIMELINE_SCREEN` that loads the already created `TimelineNavigator`, and the `MY_PROFILE` route that will render the `ProfileScreen` with the "user's data".
- [ ] `ProfileScreen` expects some paramenters in order to load the user's data. you need when the user "presses"
      the tab, you need to pass the correct parameters from the current logged user (now hardcoded). Hint: [https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator/](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator/)

- [ ] Add a custom icon for an active plain icon and outline icons for the rest
