# React Navigation

## Learning objectives

- Add an auth flow

## 🤸‍♀️ Exercise 4 Authentication

- [ ] Add an Authentication flow to your application

You can read the documentation [https://reactnavigation.org/docs/auth-flow](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/auth-flow)
_Hint:_ For now you can emulate the token with a simple `useState`. Later we will see how to use `AsyncStorage` to keep the token on the phone.
