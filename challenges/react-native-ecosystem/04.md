# React Native Ecosystem

## 📡 What you will learn

- Debug your application with isolated components

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- You can have a look at the [`storybook-for-react-native` documentation](https://github.com/storybookjs/react-native#storybook-for-react-native).

![StoryBook](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81434852/149155798-e564e0c7-dcb2-4d24-b426-e41edaa8776b.png)

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 4

- [ ] Setup StoryBook

```console
npx -p @storybook/cli sb init --type react_native
```

```console
? Do you want to install dependencies necessary to run Storybook server?
// answer Yes
```

🔭 Read the prompt, the setup is NOT 100% automated.

We are going to change our entrypoint of our application

```
───> Launch the app ─────> Open StoryBook if true
                      └──> Open our Screens
                          └── screens
                                 ├── LoginScreen.tsx
                                 ├── TermsScreen.tsx
                                 └── StarshipFeedScreen.tsx
```

- [ ] Create a new `<RootScreen.tsx />` component and copy paste your content from `App.tsx`

- [ ] Change the entrypoint of your application

```typescript
// App.tsx
import { RootScreen as App } from './src/Screens/RootScreen';
import StorybookUIRoot from './storybook';

// Should we show storybook instead of our app?
//
// ⚠️ Leave this as `false` when checking into git.
const SHOW_STORYBOOK = true;

const UI = SHOW_STORYBOOK && __DEV__ ? StorybookUIRoot : App;
export default UI;
```

- [ ] Check if everything is working
- [ ] Create a new file `/storybook/stories/Card.story.tsx`

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';
import { Button, Card, Title, Paragraph } from 'react-native-paper';

import { storiesOf } from '@storybook/react-native';

storiesOf('Card', module).add('default', () => (
  <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
    <Card>
      <Card.Content>
        <Title>Do you like this exercice?</Title>
        <Paragraph>
          Component Driven Developement makes me feel happy because it's easy to
          debug
        </Paragraph>
      </Card.Content>
      <Card.Cover source={{ uri: 'https://picsum.photos/700' }} />
    </Card>
  </View>
));
```

- [ ] import your file in the stories index. In the Web it's automatic BUT in `react-native` you need to add components by hand.

```javascript
//storybook/stories/index.js

import './Card.story.tsx';
```

- [ ] Run your app and try if it's working
- [ ] Create a new `Button.story.tsx` and add all types of buttons
- [ ] Create a new `Text.story.tsx` and add all types of Text

## 👽 Bonus

- [ ] Add [react-native-storybook-loader](https://github.com/elderfo/react-native-storybook-loader) to automatically imports

Hint: you can create your own script on `package.json` to update automatically `StoryLoader` on each launch like this

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "start:storybook": "yarn storybook:update && expo start --clear",
    "storybook:update": "rnstl --searchDir ./src --pattern '**/*.story.tsx' --outputFile ./storybook/StoryLoader.ts",
  }
}

```

- [ ] Create `*.story.tsx` files for all your components
- [ ] Update `Card.story.tsx` to add your mocked `datas.ts` from the api
- [ ] Standardize [how you write stories across projects](https://storybook.js.org/blog/how-to-use-storybook-with-eslint/)
