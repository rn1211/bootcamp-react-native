# React Native Ecosystem

## üì° What you will learn

- Having concistency across every files in your codebase
- Install a linter plugin on VSCode
- Run a linter with the cli

## üëæ Before we start the exercise

- Subscribe to [William Candillon channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC806fwFWpiLQV5y-qifzHnA) because the videos are insane

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Exercise 2

- [ ] Launch VSCode Quick Open (`cmd` + `p` or `ctrl` + `p`), paste the following command, and press enter.

```console
ext install dbaeumer.vscode-eslint esbenp.prettier-vscode
```

- [ ] Automatically format your code on each save. Go to **Code** (or **File**) > **Preferences** > **Settings**

1. type `format` on the search input
2. ‚úÖ Editor: Format on save
3. _Optional_ sometimes you have conflicts with others formatters. If it's not working just force the usage with `Prettier - code formatter`

- [ ] Install [eslint custom config from William](https://github.com/wcandillon/eslint-config-react-native-wcandillon#readme)

- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è For **linux** and **macOS** users only, If you want to create a file from the terminal you can use `echo`

```console
echo '{ "extends": "react-native-wcandillon" }' > .eslintrc
```

- [ ] ‚ùó Commit your work if it's not already done.

In the next step, we are going to install `eslint` on your project. Why are we doing this? because when you work as a team, we want to have the same setup for everyone. Consistency an adhere to standarrds across all your files is vital to your application success over time.

- [ ] Install `eslint` to your project

```console
yarn add eslint --dev
```

- [ ] Update your scripts on `package.json` to check and fix errors.

```json
// package.json

  "scripts": {
    ...
    "lint": "eslint --ignore-path .gitignore --ext .js,.ts,.tsx ."
    ...
  }
```

You don't need to manullay lint your files. We can run a script for that with:

```console
yarn lint --fix
```

- [ ] Run `yarn lint --fix` to automatically fix your errors
- [ ] Open [repo.new](https://repo.new) and create a new repo
- [ ] Commit your work
- [ ] Ship your files to the cloud to have a backup with `git push`
