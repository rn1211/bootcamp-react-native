# React Native Ecosystem

## 📡 What you will learn

- Let your computer catch errors **BEFORE** you ship bugs

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

We are ready to dive into TypeScript to catch errors as we code.

You can bookmark the [Typescript cheatsheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react), it will may help you one day.

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 3

> TypeScript has own components and own snippets. Use search or just type ts before every component snippet.

- [ ] Use the shortcut `tsrnfe` to create/update your components and move them to `./src/components/`
- [ ] Add `interface` declarations on your components

**Hint:** Here is an example with a `StarshipCard` component with 4 props `name` `model` `manufacturer` and `cost_in_credits` they are all definied in `string` because that's what we get from the api.

```typescript
import React from "react";

interface StarshipCardProps {
  name: string;
  model: string;
  manufacturer: string;
  cost_in_credits: string;
}

export function StarshipCard(props: StarshipCardProps) {
  const { name, model, manufacturer, cost_in_credits } = props
  ...
}
```

**Hint:** Not familiar with destructuring? [have a look at the patterns page](https://davidl.fr/workshop/patterns#destructuring-props).

## 👽 Bonus

Because `../../../freakingSucks/`

**Use Case**

```javascript
import { ScreenContainer } from '../../components/ScreenContainer';
```

is horrible at scale.

Instead we should be able to:

```javascript
import { ScreenContainer } from '~/components/ScreenContainer';
```

- [ ] Install `babel-plugin-module-resolver` and `babel-plugin-root-import` to add an alias for imports
