# React Native Ecosystem

## 📡 What you will learn

- Write maintainable unit tests with good testing practices
- Use React Native Testing Library (`RNTL`) —a lightweight solution for testing React Native components

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

> `RNTL` is a very light-weight solution for testing without all the implementation details. The main utilities it provides involve querying for nodes similarly to how users would find them. In this way, testing-library helps ensure your tests give you confidence in your UI code.

- Check [`RNTL` documentation](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/getting-started)

### How to write your first test

The main concept is to test how your user will "see" your application and ensure your component renders correctly.

Here's an example of a `*.test.tsx` file:

```javascript
describe('', () => {
  it('', () => {

  });
});
```

### Adding description

We will test if `Header.test.tsx` renders correctly:

```javascript
// Header.test.tsx

describe('Header', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {

  });
});
```

You need to `render` the component you want to test with `props` declaration.

_The firt time you can use `debug()` to print rendered component._

```javascript
// Header.test.tsx

import { render } from "@testing-library/react-native";
import React from "react";

import { Header } from "~/components/Header";

describe("Header", () => {
  it("renders correctly", () => {
    const { debug } = render(<Header title="SpaceCraft" />);

    debug();
  });
});
```

`getByText` is the method used to find any visible text on interactive and non-interactive elements —like a user will "see" our component.

```javascript
// Header.test.tsx

import { render } from "@testing-library/react-native";
import React from "react";

import { Header } from "~/components/Header";

describe("Header", () => {
  it("renders correctly", () => {
    const { getByText } = render(<Header title="SpaceCraft" />);

    getByText("SpaceCraft");
  });
});
```

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 5

### Setup React Native Testing Library

- [ ] [Install `@testing-library/react-native`](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-testing-library) on your project.

**Hint:** if you need some help, you can [have a look at this diff](https://github.com/flexbox/react-native-bootcamp/commit/1d44af868b2656dc0c1c01249f0af308a8b0f192)

It's time to write your first test but fist you need to double check if Jest is working properly from the terminal

- [ ] Create a new file called `hello.test.ts` and paste this working test

```javascript
// ./src/utils/hello.test.ts

it("works", () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1);
});
```

When you run `yarn test` you should have this result

```console
yarn run v1.22.17
$ jest
 PASS  src/utils/hello.test.ts

Test Suites: 3 passed, 3 total

### Test Driven Developement Workflow

Let's now create a workflow to quickly add units tests on your codebase.

- [ ] update `package.json` with a param to watch the file we change

```json
// package.json

  "test": "jest",
  "test:unit:watch": "jest --watch"
```

- [ ] Create some unit tests files
