I think you may have a question at this point.

> Master Yoda, How can I use `debugger`, `console.log()`, and React Developer Tools?

Hopefully, we have a solution to have all these tools in one place and it's based on a web browser.

## üì° What you will learn

- Using an app based on **the official React Native debugger**

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Exercise 00

- [ ] [Install React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger#installation)
- [ ] Launch your project from your terminal

```console
yarn start
```

- Open **React Native Debugger**
- Add the Metro port (Generaly it's `19000`) with `‚åò` + `t` (Or new tab like in a web browser)
- From your device you have multiple options to **open the Developer menu**:
  - Shake it if you are using a real device
  - From iOS simulator `‚åÉ` + `‚åò` + `z`
  - From Android simulator `‚åò` + `m`
  - From a terminal `m`
