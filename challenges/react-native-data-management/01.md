# React Native Data Management

> Server cache is not the same as UI state, and should be handled differently.

## What you will learn

- Fetch data over the network from the Star Wars API
- Display status and datas with `useQuery`
- Use an advanced React Pattern: [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
- Create a custom hook

## üëæ Before we start the exercise

- [ ] You should have a look at [the SWAPI documentation](https://swapi.dev/documentation#starships)
- [ ] We are going to install and use `react-query`

Here's how it works:

1. Write your data fetching functions
1. Wrap them in a named query
1. `react-query` handles caching, deduping, re-fetching, and loading states

```typescript
async function fetchData(itemId) {
  const result = await fetch(`https://example.com/api/${itemId}`);
  const json = await result.json();
  return json;
}

function Component({ itemId }) {
  const { isLoading, data } = useQuery(['exampleWithId', itemId], fetchData);

  if (isLoading) {
    return <Text>Loading‚Ä¶</Text>;
  } else {
    return <DoStuffWithData data={data} />;
  }
}
```

Back to the example we had before.

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Exercise 1

That's the screen we will create: a list of data

![Starships list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactgraphqlacademy/twitter-clone-native/master/src/exercice/05/starships.png)

- [ ] Install the library with `yarn`

```console
yarn add react-query
```

- [ ] Add a `QueryClientProvider` and wrap the application entry point of your application. You can have a look at the [`QueryClientProvider` documentation](https://react-query.tanstack.com/reference/QueryClientProvider#_top) (_Do you remeber App.tsx_?).

- [ ] Take 5 min to __read carefully__ the [`react-query` documentation](https://react-query.tanstack.com/docs/guides/queries).

- [ ] In the example `isLoading` and `isError` lives on the same files. To have a more robust application, we can wrap our queries into one custom hook `useStarships()`.

The logic is:

1. `fetch` data from the endpoint and return the result as a `json`
1. Get the result from the fetch and return the result of `useQuery`
1. Use our custom hook to render the UI

```typescript
// ./hooks/useStarships.ts
import { useQuery } from 'react-query';

async function fetchData() {
  const result = await fetch(`https://swapi.dev/api/starships/`);
  const json = await result.json();
  return json;
}

export function useStarships() {
  return useQuery(['starships'], fetchData);
}
```

üëè Now you can write `useStarships()` anywhere in your Screen and React Query handles the rest.

- [ ] Use `useStarships` hooks to **dislay a loading message**.
- [ ] Use `useStarships` hooks to **handle errors**.
- [ ] Use `useStarships` hooks to **render data**.

_Hint:_ if you are confused, you [can have a look at this app](https://github.com/flexbox/react-native-bootcamp/blob/main/hackathon/maas/src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx#L11).

## üëΩ Bonus

- [ ] Display a nice animated placeholder during loading with [react-content-loader](https://github.com/danilowoz/react-content-loader)
- [ ] Watch the talk: [Custom Hooks in React: The Ultimate UI Abstraction Layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-g9ZJha8FE) from Tanner Linsley
