# React Native Data Management

![Fetching data](https://media.giphy.com/media/3ofSB1TKqtezyJnf4Q/giphy.gif)

> Server cache is not the same as UI state, and should be handled differently.

## üì° What you will learn

- Fetch data over the network from the Star Wars API
- Display status and datas with `useQuery`
- Use an advanced React Pattern: [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
- Build [your own custom hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html)

## üëæ Before we start the exercise

- [ ] You should have a look at [the SWAPI documentation](https://swapi.py4e.com/)
- [ ] We are going to install and use `react-query`

![ReactQuery](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81434852/149154444-51df761c-bf3b-45c0-b3a3-a1c924a490bf.png)


Here's how it works:

1. Write your data fetching functions (_here it's `fetchDataWithId`_)
1. Wrap them in a named query with `queryKey` as a `string`
1. `react-query` handles caching, deduping, re-fetching, and loading states

```javascript
async function fetchDataWithId(itemId) {
  const result = await fetch(`https://example.com/api/${itemId}`);
  const json = await result.json();
  return json;
}

function Component({ itemId }) {
  const { isLoading, isError, data } = useQuery(
    ["exampleWithId", itemId],
    fetchDataWithId
  );

  if (isLoading) {
    return <Text>Loading‚Ä¶</Text>;
  }
  if (isError) {
    return <Text>Something bad happened‚Ä¶</Text>;
  }

  return <DoStuffWithData data={data} />;
}
```

Back to the example we had before.

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Exercise 1

That's the screen we will create: a list of data

![Starships list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactgraphqlacademy/twitter-clone-native/master/src/exercice/05/starships.png)

- [ ] Install the library

```console
yarn add react-query
```

- [ ] Add a `QueryClientProvider` and wrap the application entry point of your application. You can have a look at the [`QueryClientProvider` documentation](https://react-query.tanstack.com/reference/QueryClientProvider#_top)

**Hint:** Do you remember `App.tsx`?

- [ ] Take 5 min to **read carefully** the [`react-query` documentation](https://react-query.tanstack.com/docs/guides/queries).

- [ ] In the example `isLoading` and `isError` lives on the same files. To have a more robust application, we can wrap our queries into one custom hook `useStarships()`.

The logic is:

1. `fetch` data from the endpoint and return the result as a `json`
1. Get the result from the fetch and return the result of `useQuery`
1. Use our custom hook to render the UI

```javascript
// ./src/hooks/useStarships.ts
import { useQuery } from "react-query";

async function fetchData() {
  const result = await fetch(`https://swapi.py4e.com/api/starships/`);
  const json = await result.json();
  return json;
}

export function useStarships() {
  return useQuery(["starships"], fetchData);
}
```

üëè Now you can write `useStarships()` anywhere in your Screen and React Query handles the rest.

- [ ] Use `useStarships` hooks to **dislay a loading message**.
- [ ] Use `useStarships` hooks to **handle errors**.
- [ ] Use `useStarships` hooks to **render data** with a `FlatList`

**Hint:** if you are confused, you [can have a look at this app](https://github.com/flexbox/react-native-bootcamp/blob/main/hackathon/maas/src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx#L11).

## üëΩ Bonus

- [ ] Display a nice animated placeholder during loading with [react-content-loader](https://github.com/danilowoz/react-content-loader)
