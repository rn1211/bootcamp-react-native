# React Native Data Management

## Learning objectives

- Fetch and diplay datas from the Star Wars API with `useQuery`

## 🥑 Before we start the exercise

- [ ] You should have a look at [the SWAPI documentation](https://swapi.dev/documentation#starships)
- [ ] We are going to install and use `react-query`

## 🤸‍♀️ Exercise 5.2

> Fetch data over the network

![Starships list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactgraphqlacademy/twitter-clone-native/master/src/exercice/05/starships.png)

- 🥑 [`QueryClientProvider` documentation](https://react-query.tanstack.com/reference/QueryClientProvider#_top)
- 🥑 [`react-query` documentation](https://react-query.tanstack.com/docs/guides/queries)
- 🥑 [Star Wars API documentation](https://swapi.dev/documentation#starships)

- [ ] Install the library with `yarn add react-query`
- [ ] Add a `QueryClientProvider` and wrap the application. This time you need to wrap everything from `App.tsx`
- [ ] Use `useQuery` hooks with `fetchAsync('https://swapi.dev/api/starships/')` to query datas (import it from `/src/fetch.ts`), don't forget to check `react-query` documentation
- [ ] Use the `StarShipCard` to display the datas

## 🏋️‍♀️ Bonus

- [ ] [Add a modal](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/modal.html) to display all the datas about the spaceship
