# React Native Release

## Learning objectives

- Ship a PWA to production

## 🥑 Before we start the exercise

- You need to have a [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/)

## 🤸‍♀️ Exercise 2

- [ ] Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download).
- [ ] Build your Expo web app with `expo build:web`
- [ ] To deploy:
      - `cd web-build`
      - `vercel`
      - You should see a URL that you can use to view your project online.

Paste that URL into your browser when the build is complete, and you will see your deployed app!

### 🏋️‍♀️ Bonus

- Update `staging.yml` and `production.yml` to add a `build:web` step
