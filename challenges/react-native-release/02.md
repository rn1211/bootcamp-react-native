# React Native Release

## What you will learn

- Ship a PWA to production

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- You need to have a [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/)

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 2

- [ ] Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download).
- [ ] Build your Expo web app

```console
expo build:web
```

- [ ] Deploy to vercel with:

```console
cd web-build
vercel
```

You should see a URL that you can use to view your project online. Paste that URL into your browser when the build is complete, and you will see your deployed app!

## 👽 Bonus

- Update `staging.yml` and `production.yml` to add a `build:web` step

```yml

```
