# React Native Bootcamp ‚Äî A Curriculum for Beginners

> A series of **React Native coding challenges** with a variety of difficulties for busy developers.

I do `react-native` as a freelance since 2017 and I have 15+ years of experience shipping products with `JavaScript`. This bootcamp encapsulates all the problems I encounter in my daily job and all the things I wish I knew **before** starting my career as a React Native Developer.

My project-based pedagogy allows you to learn while building, a proven way for new skills to 'stick'.

üì± Hearty thanks to the [team behind expo](https://expo.io/), the open-source platform for making universal native apps with React that run on Android, iOS, and the web.

üé® Thanks as well to all the `react-native-paper` contributors for their easy to use UI library

üôè Special thanks to [Alex Lobera](https://github.com/alexlbr), [Horacio Herrera](https://twitter.com/hhg2288), [William Candillon](https://github.com/wcandillon), [Satyajit Sahoo](https://github.com/satya164), [Tanner Linsley](https://github.com/tannerlinsley), [Brent Vatne](https://github.com/brentvatne).

## Pedagogy

I have chosen two pedagogical tenets while building this curriculum: ensuring that it is hands-on **project-based** and that it **includes frequent quizzes**. In addition, this curriculum has a common theme ‚Äîcreate a mobile app with real API‚Äî to give it cohesion.

## Each lesson includes
