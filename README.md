## Meet the team

I am a freelance react-native developer, and I share a lot fo [content about the react ecosystem](https://twitter.com/flexbox_).

## Pedagogy

I have chosen two pedagogical tenets while building this curriculum: ensuring that it is hands-on **project-based** and that it **includes frequent quizzes**. In addition, this curriculum has a common theme —create a mobile app with real API— to give it cohesion.
