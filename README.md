# React Native Bootcamp for Beginners - A Curriculum

> A series of **React Native coding challenges** with a variety of difficulties.

I do `react-native` as a freelance since 2017

My project-based pedagogy allows you to learn while building, a proven way for new skills to 'stick'.

üé® Thanks as well to all the `react-native-paper` contributors for their easy to use UI library

üôè Special thanks üôè to [William Candillon](https://github.com/wcandillon), [Satyajit Sahoo](https://github.com/satya164), [Tanner Linsley](https://github.com/tannerlinsley)

## Meet the team

I am a freelance react-native developer, and I share a lot fo [content about the react ecosystem](https://twitter.com/flexbox_).

## Pedagogy

I have chosen two pedagogical tenets while building this curriculum: ensuring that it is hands-on **project-based** and that it **includes frequent quizzes**. In addition, this curriculum has a common theme ‚Äîcreate a mobile app with real API‚Äî to give it cohesion.

> If you encounter an issue, [feel free to contribute](https://github.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/issues/new), I welcome your constructive feedback!

## Each lesson includes:

- pre-lecture warmup quiz
- written lesson
- step-by-step guides on how to build the project
- a challenge
- supplemental reading
