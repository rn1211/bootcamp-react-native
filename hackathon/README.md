# React Native Hackathon

To ship your first app you should have completed all the previous exercices: **foundations**, **data management**, **ecosystem**, **navigation** and **releases**.

## Ideas

- Rick and Morty episode tracker with [rickandmortyapi](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)
- Age of Empire 2 [companion app](https://age-of-empires-2-api.herokuapp.com/docs/#/)
- Product Hunt clone
- Machine Learning application by [@flexbox](https://github.com/flexbox/machine-learning-with-javascript/tree/master/vision)
- Onboarding with magic.link by [@flexbox](https://github.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/tree/main/hackathon/onboarding)

## Getting Started the Hackathon day

- [ ] Choose a UI framework
- [ ] Select an external API
- [ ] Open [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) to assemble a plan of your screens
- [ ] Run the CLI

```console
# Vanilla React Native
npx react-native init awesome-app
npx ignite-cli new awesome-app

# Expo-powered
expo init
npx create-react-native-app
npx ignite-cli new awesome-app --expo

# Scaffold React Native libraries
npx create-react-native-library react-native-awesome-lib
```

- [ ] Use a `curl` to save local `.json` data (_to render simple components if you encounter issues to connect the api_.)
- [ ] Fetch data over the network with `react-query`
- [ ] Before the end of the day, ship your app to your expo account like [`@flexbox/detector`](https://expo.dev/@flexbox/detector)

**Hint:** If you want to know of to add and API with an auth token, have a look at this PR to [add `.env` and Authorization token with `react-query`](https://github.com/flexbox/react-native-bootcamp/pull/76).
