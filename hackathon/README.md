# React Native Hackathon

To ship your first app you should have completed all the previous exercices: **foundations**, **data management**, **ecosystem**, **navigation** and **releases**.

The tasks of the day are:

1. Use the cli to generate an app
1. Choose a UI framework
1. Select an external API (try to find an open one, of with a simple auth token)
1. Connect everything together
1. Before the end of the day, ship it to expo like [`@flexbox/detector`](https://expo.dev/@flexbox/detector)

**Hint:** If you want to know of to add and API with an auth token, have a look at this PR to [add `.env` and Authorization token with `react-query`](https://github.com/flexbox/react-native-bootcamp/pull/76).
