# Newsfeed

> Social mobile application with a news feed like Twitter, Instagram, or Dribble

## Tooling

- [Stream API](https://getstream.io/)
- [expo-activity-feed](https://davidl.fr/blog/react-native-news-feed)

 we do not have a real signup flow and we will use a pre-generated user session token, on a real-world application, your authentication backend would generate such token at log-in / signup and hand it over to the mobile app.

## Getting Started

```console
cp .env.sample .env
yarn
yarn ios|android
```
